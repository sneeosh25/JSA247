  "readme": "# espn-node [alpha]\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/espn.png?downloads=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/espn/)\n\nThis is a helper library for the ESPN API.\n\n```javascript\nvar espn = require('espn');\n\nespn\n    .setApiKey('YOUR_ESPN_API_KEY')\n    .now( function (err, json) {\n        if (err) {\n            console.error(err);\n            return;\n        }\n\n        console.log(json);\n    });\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nTo use `espn-node` in your project, simply add the following to your `package.json` file:\n\n```json\n{\n    ...\n    \"dependencies\": {\n        ...\n        \"espn\": \"0.0.4\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen run the following command to install the `espn-node` dependency as well as any others that are defined in the\n`package.json` file:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Alternate Installation\n\nInstead of adding the dependency to a `package.json` file, you can download `espn-node` and all of its dependencies\nlocally but issuing the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm install espn\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nTo begin using the `espn-node` library, initialize an object with you ESPN API key:\n\n```javascript\nvar espn = require('espn');\n\nespn.setApiKey('YOUR_ESPN_API_KEY');\n```\n\n### Alternate API Key Setting\n\nInstead of making an explicit call to `setApiKey`, you can set the API key on the process when you start up your\nNode.js application by setting the following environment variable:\n\n```bash\nAPI_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY node index.js\n```\n\nThen you can make calls to the ESPN API:\n\n```javascript\nespn.now( function (err, json) {\n    if (err) {\n        console.error(err);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    console.log(json);\n}\n```\n\n### ESPN API Resources\n\nThere are several different types of ESPN APIs available. The following is a list of ESPN API resources provided by the\n`espn-node` object:\n\n#### Now API\n\n+ `now`\n+ `nowTop`\n+ `nowPopular`\n\n## RoadMap\n\n**NOTE:** The current release (**0.0.4**) is currently a pre-release version and only implements the ESPN Now API.\n\n+ **0.1**\n  + Initial stable release that implements the ESPN Now API and Helper API\n  + Testing setup\n+ **0.2**\n  + Implements the ESPN Headlines API\n+ **0.3**\n  + Implements the ESPN Athletes API\n+ **0.4**\n  + Implements the ESPN Teams API\n+ **0.5**\n  + Implements the ESPN Scores & Schedules API\n+ **0.6**\n  + Implements the ESPN Standings API\n+ **0.7**\n  + Implements the ESPN Research Notes API\n+ **0.8**\n  + Implements the ESPN WatchESPN API\n+ **0.9**\n  + Implements the ESPN Audio API\n+ **0.10**\n  + Implements the ESPN Video API\n+ **0.11**\n  + Implements the ESPN Calendar API\n+ **0.12**\n  + Implements the ESPN Medals API\n+ **1.0**\n  + Implements all ESPN APIs\n\n## Author\n\n**Anthony Lawson**\n\n+ <https://twitter.com/anthonyglawson>\n+ <https://github.com/alawson421>\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under the MIT License.\n",
